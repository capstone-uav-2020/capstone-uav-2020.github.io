# Capstone Project 2020-2021

This is a project made for the final year Capstone course at Ontario Tech University during the academic year of 2020-2021.

The project consisted of the creation process for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Structural Firefighting with Simultaneous Localization and Mapping 
that was able to navigate through a building on fire, map the area, locate victims, and notify first responders of their positions.

We would like to thank Dr. Carlos Rossa for his mentorship during the academic year and for meeting with us regularly for updates.
