# capstone-uav-2020.github.io

This is a project made for the final year Capstone course at Ontario Tech University during the academic year of 2020-2021.

The project consisted of the creation process for an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Structural Firefighting with Simultaneous Localization and Mapping 
that was able to navigate through a building on fire, map the area, locate victims, and notify first responders of their positions.
